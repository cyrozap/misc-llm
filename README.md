# Miscellaneous LLM-Related Tools

Just a collection of files and tools that have some relevance to LLMs.
Includes some Ollama modelfiles and some small utilities to query LLMs.

I wrote these solely for my own use, but I'm publishing them here in the hopes that others may find them useful.
With that in mind, please note that I'm not accepting pull requests to this repo and I won't be responding to any issues or questions you may have.
